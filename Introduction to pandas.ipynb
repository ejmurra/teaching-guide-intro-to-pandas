    "### Using Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to write and run Python code on your computer. One way -- the method we're using today -- is to use [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which run in your browser and allow you to intersperse documentation with your code. They're handy for bundling your code with a human-readable explanation of what's happening at each step. Check out some examples from the [L.A. Times](https://github.com/datadesk/notebooks) and [BuzzFeed News](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/everything#data-and-analyses).\n",
    "\n",
    "**To add a new cell to your notebook**: Click the + button in the menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To run a cell of code**: Select the cell and click the \"Run\" button in the menu, or you can press Shift+Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**One common gotcha**: The notebook doesn't \"know\" about code you've written until you've _run_ the cell containing it. For example, if you define a variable called `my_name` in one cell, and later, when you try to access that variable in another cell but get an error that says `NameError: name 'my_name' is not defined`, the most likely solution is to run (or re-run) the cell in which you defined `my_name`."

    "### Load data into a data frame\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can start poking at a data file, you need to load the data into a pandas _data frame_, which is sort of like a virtual spreadsheet with columns and rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can load many different types of data files into a data frame, including CSVs (and other delimited text files), Excel files, JSON [and more](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/blog/2018/10/14-file-types-you-can-import-into-pandas/). ([Here's a notebook](https://github.com/ireapps/cfj-2018/blob/master/reference/Importing%20data%20into%20pandas.ipynb) demonstrating how to import some different data files, including live data from the Internet!)\n",
    "\n",
    "For today, we'll focus on importing the unaccompanied child migrants data using a pandas method called [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html). There are a ton of options you can supply when you read in the data file, but at minimum, you need to tell the method _where_ the file lives, which means you need to supply the path to the data file as a Python _string_ (some text enclosed in single or double quotes). The file is called `migrants_data.csv`, and it is located in the same directory as this notebook file, so we don't need to specify a longer path.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we import the data, we'll also _assign_ the results of the loading operation to a new variable we have decided to call _df_ (short for data frame -- easy to type, plus you'll see this pattern a lot when Googling around for help).\n",

This is the preferred method because if the column is wrongly assigned from the start, it may be formatted in a way we don't want. For example, if a string field is parsed as a number, any leading zeros are dropped from the column. But if we import it as a string from the start we will keep those leading zeros. You do this by specifying a dtype argument to `read_csv()`. This argument can be a dictionary that's keys are column names and values are dtypes, or if every column is the same type you can just pass that type as the argument."
